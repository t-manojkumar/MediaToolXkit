A modern, all-in-one desktop application for Windows that provides a suite of powerful image and video processing tools, wrapped in a beautiful Fluent UI inspired by Windows 11.

This toolkit combines four powerful utilities into a single, easy-to-use application:

- **Image Splitter**  
  Divide any image into a custom grid (e.g., 2√ó2 profile grid) with just a few clicks and live preview.

- **Image Upscaler**  
  Enlarge images by 2√ó, 4√ó, or up to 8√ó using high-quality Lanczos/HighQualityCubic interpolation to maintain clarity.

- **Extract Frames**  
  Load a video file and quickly extract a specified number of frames to save high-quality stills.

- **Find Best Image**  
  Select a group of similar photos, and the app uses a sharpness-based scoring algorithm to identify the best-focused image.
