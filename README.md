\## ‚ú® Features



This toolkit combines four powerful utilities into a single, easy-to-use application:



\* \*\*Image Splitter:\*\* Split any image into a custom grid (e.g., 2x2 for a profile grid) with just a few clicks and see a live preview of the results.

\* \*\*Image Upscaler:\*\* Enlarge images by 2x, 4x, or up to 8x their original size using high-quality Lanczos/HighQualityCubic interpolation to maintain clarity.

\* \*\*Extract Frames:\*\* Load a video file, and the app will quickly extract a specified number of frames, allowing you to save high-quality stills from your footage.

\* \*\*Find Best Image:\*\* Select a group of similar photos, and the app uses a scoring algorithm based on sharpness to automatically find the best-focused one and highlight it.
